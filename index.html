<h1> Making a Convincing Argument </h1>

 <h2> Backfire Effect </h2>
 
<p>
Both the video and debunking handbook talk about the backfire effect that can occur while trying to convince someone that information they previously thought was true, actually was a myth. In the backfire effect, the target that believes the misconception can very easily forget what the misconception  is if it is not presented carefully. In other instances, the target could also out right deny that they are wrong in the first place. Additionally, Cairo emphasizes that the way information is presented is just as important as the information itself. Although he is primarily talking about visualizations, this is consistent with the message the other two sources communicate. It is important that information, and especially misconceptions, are relayed in a way that does not end up with a backfire effect. One way to avoid the backfire effect is to not overload the target audience with too much information but to make sure to give a small amount of new information to replace the gap left by the misconception.

 <h2> My Cause </h2>

 Coffee is good for you! In addition to being delicious, coffee can be a great way to start the day with a boost of energy.
 It's also a social drink and a great way to catch up with friends and family. Because of its popularity, coffee is one of the most studied beverages. One misconception about coffee is that it stunts your growth. However, there is no scientific study that supports this conclusion. Excessive amount of caffeine  may factor into the growth of children specifically but coffee is not the culprit. Additionally, it's very easy to brew at home! If you don't have time to do it yourself, there are many coffee shops that you can stop by and many of them have continent drive-thrus.
